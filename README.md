# CoverLetter automation

I want to write a simple script that will automate the process of writing cover letters.

I want to be able to write a cover letter once, and then have the script fill in the blanks for me.

So I have two ideas about how to do this:
1. use R and pagedown with variable names to fill this in
2. use Python to fill in the blanks and write to a word document or markdown file

I will try the python route first as I find the text manipulation is more effective there.
